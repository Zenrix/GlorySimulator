Fast and loose description of the game:

The game will start you in a simulated league, each team will have their current TKA rosters with some filler characters to bring every roster to 10 total players.

You can either buy out an existing player slot or fight through the promotion tournament. For example, you could buy out Team Blue Rain and play using that team for the season. However, if you purchase a team slot there is a high likelihood that players will transfer out.

You can fill your teams roster by hiring from a randomly generated "Rookie Pool." Or you can customize your own players.

Then you go into the regular seasons, matches will be simulated in a turn based fashion (think pokemon esque combat, one action per turn). While you won't be able to directly control your players, you will be able to see the battle unfold (probably through text for now). I may add a feature to let you play as one person on your team.

Players/characters will have stats and moves depending on their player stats, class, perks, and equipment.

These players will be trained and gain "Perks" over the course of the season. Perks will do interesting things like strengthening stats or providing a bonus. For example, a current perk "Master Tactician" will make your team stronger the longer a team match goes on.(edited)

Some perks will be limited. Only four players may have "Master Tactician" at any time. In order to train one of your players in it another player will have to either lose it or retire. (Or you can simply buy the contract of a player with the desired limited perk).
